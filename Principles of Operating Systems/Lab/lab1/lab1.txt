AfterAT&Thad dropped out of theMulticsproject, theUnixoperating system was conceived and implemented byKen ThompsonandDennis Ritchie(both ofAT&T Bell Laboratories) in 1969 and first released in 1970. Later they rewrote it in a new programming language,C, to make it portable. The  availability  and  portability  of  Unix  caused  it  to  be  widely  adopted,  copied  and  modified  by academic institutions and businesses.In  1977,  theBerkeley  Software  Distribution(BSD)  was  developed  by  theComputer  Systems Research  Group(CSRG)  fromUC  Berkeley,  based  on  the6th  edition  of  Unixfrom  AT&T.  Since BSD contained Unix code that AT&T owned, AT&T filed a lawsuit (USL v. BSDi) in the early 1990s against the University of California. This strongly limited the development and adoption of BSD. In  1983,Richard  Stallmanstarted  theGNU  projectwith  the  goal  of  creating  a  free  UNIX-like operating  system.As  part  of  this  work,  he  wrote  theGNU  General  Public  License(GPL).  By  the early  1990s,  there  was  almost  enough  available  software  to  create  a  full  operating  system. However,  the  GNU  kernel,  calledHurd,  failed  to  attract  enough  development  effort,  leaving  GNU incomplete. In  1985,Intelreleased  the80386,  the  firstx86  microprocessorwith  a32-bitinstruction  setand amemory management unitwithpaging. In  1986,  Maurice  J.  Bach,  of  AT&T  Bell  Labs,  publishedThe  Design  of  the  UNIX  Operating System.This  definitive  description  principally  covered theSystem  V  Release  2kernel, with some new features fromRelease 3and BSD.In  1987,MINIX,  a  Unix-like  system  intended  for  academic  use,  was  released  byAndrew  S. Tanenbaumto exemplify the principles conveyed in histextbook,Operating Systems: Design and Implementation.  While  source  code  for  the  system  was  available,  modification  and  redistribution were restricted. In addition, MINIX's16-bitdesign was not well adapted to the 32-bit features of the increasingly cheap and popular Intel 386 architecture for personal computers. In the early nineties a commercial UNIX operating system for Intel 386 PCs was too expensive for private users. These factors and the lack of a widely adopted,freekernel provided the impetus for Torvalds' starting his project. He has stated that if either the GNU Hurd or386BSDkernels had been available at the time, he likely would not have written his own. Linus  Torvalds  had  wanted  to  call  his  invention  Freax,  aportmanteauof  "free",  "freak",  and  "x" (as an allusion to Unix). During the start of his work on the system, he stored the files under the name  "Freax"  for  about  half  of  a  year.  Torvalds  had  already  considered  the  name  "Linux",  but initially dismissed it as too egotistical. In  order  to  facilitate  development,  the  files  were  uploaded  to  theFTP  serverofFUNETin September  1991.  Ari  Lemmke  atHelsinki  University  of  Technology(HUT),  who  was  one  of  the volunteer  administrators  for  the  FTP  server  at  the  time,  did  not  think  that  "Freax"  was  a  good name.  So,  he  named  the  project  "Linux"  on  the  server  without  consulting  Torvalds.Later, however, Torvalds consented to "Linux"
